🚀 Excited to share my latest project: **Elavia.Ai** - An AI-Powered Document Intake & Extraction Microservice!

I've built a production-ready OCR platform that intelligently extracts and processes documents using multiple cutting-edge OCR engines. Here's what makes it special:

**Key Features:**
✨ Multi-engine OCR support (Gemini, Tesseract, PaddleOCR, Qwen-2.5-VL-32B, Surya)
⚡ Real-time processing with live progress tracking
🗄️ Dual storage (MongoDB + JSON for persistence)
🎨 Clean, professional black/white minimalist UI
📊 Dashboard with real-time statistics
🎬 Embedded video demo & documentation

**Tech Stack:**
• Backend: FastAPI + MongoDB (async with Motor)
• Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
• Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend)
• APIs: Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and open-source OCR engines

**Project Links:**
🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/Hiteshydv001/Elavia-OCR
🌐 Live Demo: https://elavia-ocr.vercel.app
📹 Video Walkthrough: https://youtu.be/w0uX_imnwuw
📖 Documentation: Check the comprehensive README in repo

**What I Learned:**
→ Building scalable microservices with async processing
→ Integrating multiple AI/ML APIs seamlessly
→ Production deployment strategies (Vercel + Render)
→ Real-time UX patterns (polling, loading states, notifications)
→ Thoughtful API design with error handling

The platform handles document uploads, processes them through selected OCR engines, extracts structured data, and stores results persistently. Users get real-time feedback with a professional, responsive interface.

Open to feedback and collaboration! 🤝

## Extended Version (For More Engagement):

🚀 Just launched **Elavia.Ai** - An AI-Powered Document Intake & Extraction Platform!

After weeks of development, I'm thrilled to share this production-ready microservice that combines intelligent OCR, real-time processing, and a polished user experience.

**The Challenge:**
Organizations need a reliable way to process documents at scale - extracting text, parsing structure, and storing results efficiently.

**The Solution:**
Elavia.Ai uses 5 advanced OCR engines (Gemini, Tesseract, PaddleOCR, Qwen, Surya) to intelligently extract and process documents with:
• Asynchronous background processing
• Real-time progress tracking
• Persistent result storage (MongoDB + JSON)
• Professional, intuitive interface
• Complete API documentation

**Technical Highlights:**
✅ FastAPI with async/await for high performance
✅ Motor (async MongoDB driver) for scalable DB
✅ Vanilla JavaScript SPA for responsive UX
✅ Conditional CSS loading for optimal performance
✅ Deployed on Vercel + Render for production reliability
✅ Comprehensive error handling & graceful fallbacks
